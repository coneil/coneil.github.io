As someone with terrible recall and a dodgy memory, notes become important. Thanks to catching the `.dev` top-level domain name's public release in March of '19, I now have this appropriately named site. It is a void that needs to be filled. And seeing as my head refuses to retain much, it seems only fitting to dump its contents here where it may be referenced another day.
